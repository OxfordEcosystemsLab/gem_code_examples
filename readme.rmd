# Contributors

This github repo contains up-to-date Net primary production calculation method following data collected with [GEM protocol](http://gem.tropicalforests.ox.ac.uk/page/resources)

The scripts were written with joint efforts of multiple researchers in [Oxford Ecosystem Lab](https://www.oxfordecosystems.org/)

# Kick start

The instruction contains basic information, and step-by-step method of NPP calculation (still developing) 

In each folder, there are input files, codes, and output files. You are suggested to look for R script tagged with `teaching` which is the main script for calculation

# Caveat

The calculation of NPP differs from site to site! The **correct** way to use these scripts is to read it and understand the method of calculation, then tailor the script for your site.

All input data have been **falsified**, they have NO ecological meaning, just toy dataset.
