# TO DO: Add a SPIKE DETECTION FUNCTION
# Get the SD of mean of 2 points before and 2 points after, to detect spikes in data.
# Add SD per subplot / measurement

## new flux correction based on overall fluxes:
rm.flux.outlier <- function(flux_overall, sd_interval) {
  flux_overall[which(flux_overall == "-Inf")] <- NA
  outliers = mean(flux_overall,na.rm=T) + sd_interval*sd(flux_overall,na.rm=T)
  flux_overall[which(flux_overall < 0)] <- 0
  flux_overall[which(flux_overall > outliers)] <- NA
  return(flux_overall)
}

## remove temperature outlier:
# temperature smaller than 5 or larger than 50 will be removed, and replaced with mean monthly temperature
rm.temp.outlier <- function(temp, month) {
  temp[which(temp<5)]=NA   
  temp[which(temp>50)]=NA   
  xtemp <- NULL
  ## run through 12 months to find xtemp:
  for (i in 1:12) {
    xtemp[i] <-mean(temp[which(month == i)],na.rm=T)
    temp[which(is.na(temp) & month == i)] <- xtemp[i]
  }
